## LOREM

This is a simple website using filler text to demonstrate my basic understanding of web design for Code Louisville's Front End Web Development course.

I chose to just use lorem-ipsum and a black & white design because I was too distracted in trying to think of a project concept. This was I could just focus on the code itself.

## My project includes the following features:

1.  Uses a **Media Query** to change the H1 and description from a single column into two side-by-side items.

2.  Uses **Flexbox to organize content** based on screen size. _CSS Requirement #2_

3.  The **Nav is shown/hidden using CSS and JavaScript** by clicking on the hamburger icon. _CSS Requirement #1_

        The code adds / removes a css class to the html which reveals or hides the navigation menu. The same function runs whenever the user selects a menu item so that the naivation menu closes.

4.  Hamburger Icon is **animated** using CSS. _Css Requirement #6_

5.  User generated content is added dynamically by using a JS function that **pushes user-inputed data into an array** which is then added to the html. _JavaScript Requirements #3 and #4_
