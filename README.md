## LOREM

This is a simple website using filler text to demonstrate my basic understanding of web design for Code Louisville's Front End Web Development course.

I chose to just use lorem-ipsum and a black & white design because I was too distracted in trying to think of a project concept. This was I could just focus on the code itself.

## My project includes the following features:

1. Uses Flexbox to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. Notice how the h1 and the description change from 1 column to two on a larger screen. Content boxes below also rearrange based on screen size.

2. The Nav is shown/hidden using JavaScript hit clicking on the hamburger icon. The code adds / removes a css class to the html which reveals and hides the navigation menu. The same function runs whenever the user selects a menu item so that the naivation menu closes.

3. User generated content is added dynamically by using a JS function that pushes user-inputed data into an array which is then added to the html.
