## LOREM

This is a simple website using filler text to demonstrate my basic understanding of web design for Code Louisville's Front End Web Development course.

I chose to just use lorem-ipsum and a black & white design because I was too distracted in trying to think of a project concept. This was I could just focus on the code itself.

## My project includes the following features:

1. Uses **Flexbox to organize user-generated content** based on screen size.

2. Uses a Media Query to change the H1 and description from a single column into two side-by-side items.

3. The H1 and the description sections change from 1 column to two columns using a **media querey**.

4. The **Nav is shown/hidden using JavaScript** hit clicking on the hamburger icon. The code adds / removes a css class to the html which reveals or hides the navigation menu. The same function runs whenever the user selects a menu item so that the naivation menu closes.

5. User generated content is added dynamically by using a JS function that **pushes user-inputed data into an array** which is then added to the html.
