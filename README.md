## LOREM

This is a simple website using filler text to demonstrate my basic understanding of web design for Code Louisville's Front End Web Development course.

I chose to just use lorem-ipsum and a black & white design because I was too distracted in trying to think of a project concept. This was I could just focus on the code itself.

My project includes the following features:

1. Uses Flexbox to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. Notice how the h1 and the description change from 1 column to two on a larger screen. Content boxes below also rearrange based on screen size.

2. Nav is opened / clsoed with the hamburger icon. Also switches to a top-navigation at proper screen size.

3. The mobile Nav is shown/hidden using JavaScript code. The code adds / removes a css class to the html which reveals and hides the navigation menu.
